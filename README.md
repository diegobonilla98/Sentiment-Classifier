# Sentiment-Classifier-ANN

Comment classifier inspired by the book I'm reading (Deep Learning with Python). Uses some comments from amazon, imdb and yelp for trainning so actually does a pretty good job at classifying any comment from any subject.
The model did reach a very good accuracy and (this time) a very convincing loss.
It can be used (and It has been tested) to classify any comment from movies, products and places to good or bad review.
The model and the idea is very popular and easy to replicate, if searched well a lot of help of the subject can be found.
Also, and as simple as that, recognizes and language using the googletrans API.
